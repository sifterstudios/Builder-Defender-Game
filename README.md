#### What I've learned

- Heavy use of scriptable objects and inheritance for different resources and materials
- Handling multi-scene transitions and persistance between these
- Focus on abstracting away as much as possible to reduce coupling
- Use of Render Texture to create simple minimap
- Simple Building shader and use of translusency for building placements
- Created tooltip-system for giving additional info
- System for automatically populating UI based in # of scriptable objects in folder
